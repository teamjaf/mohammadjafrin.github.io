# mohammadjafrin.github.io

This repository contains the source for my personal site hosted on GitHub Pages. The landing page introduces me as a
software engineer, highlights areas of focus, and shares ways to connect.

## Local development

You can open `index.html` directly in a browser to preview the page. No additional tooling is required.

## Deployment

Pushing the latest changes to the `main` branch will publish the site automatically at
[https://mohammadjafrin.github.io](https://mohammadjafrin.github.io).
